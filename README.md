    Predictive Modeling
    Model Evaluation
Steps in the Project

    Data Exploration:
        Key statistics and visualizations to understand data distribution.
        Handling missing or inconsistent data.
    Preprocessing:
        Encoding categorical variables.
        Scaling numerical features.
        Handling class imbalance.
    Modeling:
        Algorithms used (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.).
        Tuning techniques (e.g., Grid Search, Random Search).
    Evaluation:
        Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.
        Cross-validation performance.
Dependencies

    Python libraries used: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

How to Run

    
Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the notebook:

    jupyter notebook Credit_Card_Default_Prediction(2).ipynb

    Follow the step-by-step workflow.

Future Scope

    Incorporating additional features for better prediction.
    Testing advanced models like XGBoost or ensemble techniques.
